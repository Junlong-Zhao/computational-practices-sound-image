# Week 2 Notes

- Learned how to manipulate pixels directly with loadPixels() and updatePixels().
- Explored different transformations:
  - Thresholding → Two Color
  - Row-based → Stripe Makers
  - Alternating pattern → Checkerboard
  - Region-based → Half/Half
- Key concept: Each pixel is stored in a 1D array, index = x + y * width.
- Processing’s `brightness()` function helps analyze luminance.
