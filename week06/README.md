# Week 6 — Digital Sound & Oscillation

## What I did
- Installed and used the **Processing Sound** library.
- Designed a short **sci-fi “planet landing”** sound using **three oscillators** (Sin, Saw, Tri) with envelopes and time-varying frequency (FM-style sweeps).
- Built a **sound-reactive visualization** driven by oscillator output (amplitude + frequency) to control colour, size, and geometry.

## Files
- `week06_scifi_arrival.pde` — press **SPACE** to trigger the arrival sound; `←/→` shifts global pitch, `S` saves a frame.
- `week06_sound_visuals.pde` — press **1/2/3** to switch the analysed oscillator (Sin/Saw/Tri), `A` toggles auto-sweep, `S` saves a frame.
