# Week 3 – Vector Graphics

## What I did
- Practised vector primitives and 2D transformations (translate / rotate / scale / pushMatrix / popMatrix).
- Replicated a geometric artwork in the style of **Piet Mondrian** using subdivided rectangles, primary colours, and bold black lines.

## Files
- `week03_transform_practice.pde` – small exercises to demonstrate transformations.
- `week03_mondrian_final.pde` – final artwork (press **R** to recompose, **S** to save a PNG).

## Demo Videos
- [Transform practice](./week3-practice.mp4)
- [Mondrian final](./week3-final.mp4)
